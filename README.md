# Movie-Library

This is my first simple project made in the QT environment in C++ for a course assignment in the first year of studies. It is a simple movie rental system with the ability to log in and browse the movie library. 
The entire database of movies and user account data are contained in text files because I did not know how to use SQL at that time.
The project is also not object-oriented because I did not know how to write object-oriented code back then.
